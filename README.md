##Description:
This project demonstrates file handling operations in Java, focusing on reading, writing, and modifying text files dynamically. Using Javaâ€™s java.io and java.nio.file packages, the program allows users to create a file, write content into it, read the stored data, and modify specific words within the file. It is compatible with Java 8 and above, utilizing methods like Files.readAllLines() and Files.write(). The implementation involves user interaction through the Scanner class, enabling dynamic input and file manipulation. Additionally, try-catch blocks are used to handle potential IOExceptions, ensuring smooth execution. The structured approach includes file creation, writing, reading, and modification, making it a practical exercise for understanding Java I/O operations. This project was developed and executed in Eclipse IDE, providing an easy-to-debug environment.
